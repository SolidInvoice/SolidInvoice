2.3.17
======

* API tokens are now stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes (keyed by `SOLIDINVOICE_APP_SECRET`)
  instead of plaintext. The `Version20317` migration re-hashes all existing tokens
  in place, so previously issued tokens continue to work without user action.
* Existing tokens are no longer recoverable from the database or visible in the UI.
  After upgrading, the management page only lists token names; the value itself is
  shown exactly once at creation time and must be copied immediately.
* Rotating `SOLIDINVOICE_APP_SECRET` now invalidates all API tokens (previously it
  only invalidated sessions). After rotating the secret, users must generate new
  API tokens.

2.0.0
=====

* `SolidInvoice\NotificationBundle\Notification\ChainedNotificationInterface::addNotifications` and `SolidInvoice\NotificationBundle\Notification\ChainedNotification::addNotifications` has been renamed to `addNotification`
