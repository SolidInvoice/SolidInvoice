Contributing
------------

If you wish to contribute to SolidInvoice, please fork it, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Where possible, pull requests need to have unit tests available, and the unit tests should not fail.

All pull requests must conform to the standards of coding currently in the application. Pull requests that do not follow standards, won't be denied, but we will ask you to change the code before we accept the pull request.

If you encounter any bug or inconsistency, please submit a bug report, so we can fix it as quickly as possible.
